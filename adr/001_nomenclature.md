# ADR 002: Common nomenclature

> ::info::
> status = proposed

## Context

We need a set of well-defined terms to describe the different abstract concepts, components and artifacts of the SDK.

## Decision

Throughout the project, the following terms should be interpreted according the presented definition:

- Headless dApp: A software system integrated with a blockchain that is meant to be operated programmatically (through an API, without a frontend).
- Hollow: An SDK (Software Development Kit) for building headless dApps.
- Bod: an instance of a headless dapp built using Hollow (analogous to an Actor in the Actor Model)
- Crane: an execution runtime for hosting bods (headless dapps)
