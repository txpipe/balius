# CLI

The `cargo balius` CLI provides a set of commands to help you create, build, and test your headless dApps on the Balius framework.

This section provides detailed documentation for each available command:

- [**init**](./cli/commands/init) - Initialize a new Balius project
- [**build**](./cli/commands/build) - Build your Balius project as a WebAssembly component
- [**test**](./cli/commands/test) - Run your Balius project in a local test environment

## Getting Started

Before using Balius commands, make sure you have the `cargo-balius` CLI tool installed:

```bash
cargo install cargo-balius
```

You can run any command with the `--help` flag to see available options:

```bash
cargo balius --help
cargo balius init --help
cargo balius build --help
cargo balius test --help
```

## Command Overview

### Init Command

The `init` command creates a new Balius project with the necessary boilerplate. Simply provide a project name as an argument, and it sets up the required files and directories. The name will be automatically sanitized to be a valid Rust package name.

```bash
cargo balius init my-project
```

### Build Command

The `build` command compiles your Balius project to WebAssembly and converts it to a component format that can be used by the Balius runtime.

### Test Command

The `test` command runs your project in a local test environment with a JSON-RPC server and connections to UTXoRPC services, allowing you to test your dApp locally.

```bash
cargo balius test --utxo-url "https://preview.utxorpc-v0.demeter.run" --utxo-api-key "your-api-key"
```

## Required External Tools

Some Balius commands require external tools:

- **wasm-tools**: Required for the `build` command to convert WebAssembly files to component format
- **Rust wasm32 target**: Required for compiling to WebAssembly (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)

## Environment Setup

For the `test` command, you'll need API keys for the UTXoRPC service. These can be provided either as command-line options or as environment variables (`UTXO_URL` and `UTXO_API_KEY`).
