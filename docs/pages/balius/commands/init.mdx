# Init Command

The `init` command helps you bootstrap a new Balius project with the necessary structure and configuration files.

## Usage

```bash
cargo balius init <project-name>
```

The project name will be sanitized automatically (converted to lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens, etc.).

## Arguments

- **project-name** - The name for your new Balius project
  - The name will be automatically sanitized to be a valid Rust package name
  - Special characters will be removed or replaced with hyphens
  - If the sanitized name is different from your input, you'll be informed of the change

## Examples

### Create a new project

```bash
cargo balius init my awesome dapp
# Result: Package name will be: my-awesome-dapp
```

### Create a project with a complex name

```bash
cargo balius init My.Cool_Project!
# Result: Package name will be: my-cool_project
```

## Project Structure

After running the `init` command, your project will have the following structure:

```
my-awesome-dapp/
├── Cargo.toml          # Project manifest with appropriate dependencies
└── src/
    └── lib.rs          # Main library file with boilerplate code
```

## Next Steps

After initializing your project, you can:

1. Navigate to your project directory: `cd my-awesome-dapp`
2. Build your project: `cargo balius build`
3. Test your project: `cargo balius test`
