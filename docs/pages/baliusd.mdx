# Balius Daemon (baliusd)

The Balius Daemon (`baliusd`) is a runtime environment that can execute Balius headless dApps in production environments. It is part of the Balius tooling ecosystem alongside the `balius` Cargo plugin.

## Overview

`baliusd` serves as the execution engine for Balius dApps, providing:

- A standardized environment for running WebAssembly components built with Balius
- Management of connections to blockchain nodes and services
- HTTP APIs for interacting with your dApp
- Background tasks and event processing
- State persistence
- Configuration management

## Installation

You can install the Balius daemon directly from cargo:

```bash
cargo install baliusd
```

## Usage

To run the Balius daemon:

```bash
baliusd
```

The daemon doesn't require any command line parameters as it automatically searches for configuration files in specific locations.

### Configuration Files

The Balius daemon searches for configuration files in the following order:

1. `/etc/baliusd/daemon.toml` (system-wide configuration, optional)
2. `baliusd.toml` in the current working directory (optional)

Configuration options from later sources override earlier ones. For example, settings in `baliusd.toml` will override those in `/etc/baliusd/daemon.toml`.

### Configuration Format

The Balius daemon is configured using a TOML file. Here's an example configuration:

```toml
# JSON-RPC server configuration
[rpc]
listen_address = "0.0.0.0:3000"

# Logging configuration
[logging]
max_level = "debug"
include_tokio = true

# UTXoRPC Ledger configuration
[ledger]
endpoint_url = "UTXoRPC-url"
api_key = "your-api-key"

# Chain synchronization configuration
[chainsync]
endpoint_url = "UTXoRPC-url"
api_key = "your-api-key"

# Define workers to be loaded
[[workers]]
name = "dapp-name"
module = "bin/dapp-name.wasm"
config = "dapp-config.json"

[[workers]]
name = "dapp2-name"
module = "bin/dapp2-name.wasm"
config = "dapp2-name.json"
```

### Worker Configuration Files

Each worker can have an optional JSON configuration file specified by the `config` parameter in the worker definition. These configuration files should be located in the same directory as your `baliusd.toml` file, or use an absolute path.

For example, if you're running baliusd from `/home/user/myproject` with a `baliusd.toml` file there, you would place worker configs like `wallet.json` in that same directory.

## Example Directories

The Balius repository includes example configurations for both mainnet and preview network:

- `example-mainnet/`: Contains sample configuration for Cardano mainnet
- `example-preview/`: Contains sample configuration for Cardano preview testnet

To use these examples, navigate to one of these directories and run `baliusd` from there.

## Running Multiple Apps

One of the key features of baliusd is its ability to run multiple dApps simultaneously within a single process.

## API Access

When running, baliusd exposes APIs for each loaded app at:

```
http://{host}:{port}/{app_name}/...
```

For example, if configured on localhost port 8080 with a wallet app:

```
http://localhost:8080/wallet/...
```

## Relationship to Other Balius Components

- **balius-sdk**: dApps built with balius-sdk can be compiled to WebAssembly and run by baliusd
- **balius-runtime**: The library that powers baliusd's execution environment
- **balius**: CLI tool that helps build WebAssembly components compatible with baliusd
