# Marketplace Example

The following code shows what the off-chain code looks like for basic NFT marketplace that uses the `Hollow` SDK.

The idea is simple: the marketplace address can lock NFT and release them only if the correct price for the NFT is paid. To accomplish that, our off-chain component is going to do the following:

- for each time our marketplace address receives an UTxO representing an buyable asset, we store a reference in database table.
- for each time our marketplace address releases an UTxO representing a buyable asset, we remove it from our database table.
- if someone wants to query the list available assets, we lookup available items in the db and provide them as a json values.
- if someone want to buy one of the available assets, we create a partial transaction and return it for the user to balance & sign.

Here's the code:

::warning:: this is WIP, specific function names and structures will most likely suffer some changes. The essence of the framework and the semantic meaning of the artifacts will remain.

```rust
const MARKETPLACE: &str = "addr1xxx";

#[derive(Datum)]
struct AssetDatum {
    price: PlutusInt,
}

#[chain_event]
#[match_inbound_utxo(to_address=MARKETPLACE)]
fn on_new_asset(utxo: UTxO) -> Result<()> {
    let db = use_extension::<Database>();

    let datum = utxo.datum_as::<AssetDatum>();

    if datum.is_none() {
        bail!("unexpected utxo");
    }

    for asset in utxo.assets() {
        db.execute(
            "INSERT INTO (policy, asset, price) VALUES ({}, {}, {})",
            asset.policy_id,
            asset.asset_name,
            datum.price,
        );
    }

    Ok(())
