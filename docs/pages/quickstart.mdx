# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Balius, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Rust**: Balius is built with Rust, so you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the official instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Cargo**: Cargo is Rust's package manager and build tool. It comes pre-installed with Rust, so if you have Rust installed, you should already have Cargo.

## Create a new Rust project

```bash
cargo new my_dapp
```

## Add Balius as a dependency

To add Balius as a dependency to your project, open your `Cargo.toml` file and add the following line under the `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
balius = "0.1.0"
```

Then, run `cargo build` to download and compile the dependencies.

## Add a hello world script

```rust
fn say_hello(name: String) -> Result<String> {
    Ok(format!("Hello, {}!", name))
}

#[balius::main]
fn main(config: Config) -> balius::Worker {
    balius::Worker::new()
        .handle_request("say-hello", say_hello)
}
```
