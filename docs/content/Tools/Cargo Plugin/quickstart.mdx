The `balius` Cargo plugin provides a set of commands to help you create, build, and test your headless dApps on the Balius framework.

This section provides detailed documentation for each available command:

- [**init**](./balius/commands/init) - Initialize a new Balius project
- [**build**](./balius/commands/build) - Build your Balius project as a WebAssembly component
- [**test**](./balius/commands/test) - Run your Balius project in a local test environment

## Getting Started

Before using Balius commands, make sure you have the `balius` Cargo plugin installed:

```bash
cargo install balius
```

You can run any command with the `--help` flag to see available options:

```bash
cargo balius --help
cargo balius init --help
cargo balius build --help
cargo balius test --help
```

## Command Overview

### Init Command

The `init` command creates a new Balius project with the necessary boilerplate. It sets up your project with the proper dependencies (balius-sdk and other required libraries), file structure, and initial configuration. Simply provide a project name as an argument, and it sets up the required files and directories. The name will be automatically sanitized to be a valid Rust package name.

```bash
cargo balius init my-project
```

### Build Command

The `build` command compiles your Balius project to WebAssembly and converts it to a component format that can be used by the Balius runtime or the baliusd daemon.

### Test Command

The `test` command runs your project in a local test environment with a JSON-RPC server and connections to UTXoRPC services, allowing you to test your dApp locally.

```bash
cargo balius test --utxo-url "utxorpc-url" --utxo-api-key "your-api-key"
```

## Required External Tools

Some Balius commands require external tools:

- **wasm-tools**: Required for the `build` command to convert WebAssembly files to component format
- **Rust wasm32 target**: Required for compiling to WebAssembly (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)

## Environment Setup

For the `test` command, you'll need API keys for the UTXoRPC service. These can be provided either as command-line options or as environment variables (`UTXO_URL` and `UTXO_API_KEY`).

## Relationship to Other Balius Components

The `balius` Cargo plugin works alongside other components in the Balius ecosystem:

- It creates projects that use **balius-sdk** for the core dApp functionality
- It builds WebAssembly components that can be executed by **balius-runtime** or **baliusd**
- It provides a testing environment that simulates what **baliusd** would do in production

While you can manually set up and build Balius projects without the Cargo plugin, using `balius` simplifies the development workflow significantly.
