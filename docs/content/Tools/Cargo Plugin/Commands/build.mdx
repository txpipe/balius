The `build` command compiles your Balius project into a WebAssembly component that can be executed by the Balius runtime.

## Usage

```bash
cargo balius build
```

## Process

The `build` command performs the following steps:

1. Executes `cargo build` with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
2. Converts the generated `.wasm` file into a WebAssembly component using `wasm-tools`

## What It Does

This command:

1. Compiles your project to WebAssembly targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
2. Locates the built `.wasm` file in your target directory
3. Uses `wasm-tools` to convert it into a component WebAssembly file with the name format `{package_name}-c.wasm`

## Requirements

- WebAssembly target support in your Rust toolchain (install with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
- The `wasm-tools` command-line utility must be installed in your path

## Build Outputs

After running the build command, you'll find:

- A standard WebAssembly file at `./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/{package_name}.wasm`
- A component WebAssembly file at `./{package_name}-c.wasm` in your project root directory

## Next Steps

After building your project:

1. Test it with `cargo balius test`
2. Deploy your WebAssembly component to a Balius runtime
